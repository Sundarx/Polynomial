# PolynomialADT

Each polynomial is represented as a linked list, where each node named polyNode contains the coefficient and the exponent of a term of the polynomial.

The user has the option to create a polynomial, read and write a polynomial, and add a pair of polynomials. In order to add a pair of polynomials, both linked lists are traversed.

The test data was hardcoded into the demo program to test for:

(p1 + p2) where p1=4x^3+3x^2-5 and p2=3x^5+4x^4+x^3-4x^2+4x^1+2

(p3 + p4) where p3=-5x^0+3x^2+4x^3 and p4=-4x^0+4x^3+5x^4
